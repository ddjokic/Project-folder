<h4>Project folder</h4>

Command line scripts (windows - bat and Unix/Linux - sh) to create project subfolders. I am using them when I have big project to manage. Folder structure is tuned to my way of managing offshore or shipbuilding (design, construction, overall management) project.</p>
<h5>Usage</h5>
Copy appropriate script file into top folder, where you want to store your project, and run command line scripts.

**On Windows:** from command line run "*.bat script"</p>
**Unix/Linux:** from terminal type "bash project.sh"</p>
Scripts will create folder "Project" with subfolder structure. Rename created folder "Project" in something what makes sense for you.</p>
Feel free to use, modify, twist or watsoever you want to do with these scripts. Those will not break your computer, hard disk or whatever hardware/software you have. However, if that happen, do not call me as there is no support or warranty of any kind. Use them at your own risk.
